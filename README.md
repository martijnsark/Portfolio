I made many projects containing a wide variety of coding lanquages which include: C# unity, C# visual studio console app, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, PHP, with as honourable mention Unreal Engine blueprints.

I have also worked with quite some hardware like: raspberry pi-top, makey makey, aldruino.

I mostly work with Unity and C# to see projects with those you can look at my portfolio to see video's of this.
